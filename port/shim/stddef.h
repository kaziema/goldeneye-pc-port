 * it shadows the host header, so libstdc++'s <cstddef> never sees the host's
 * max_align_t/size_t and fails to compile. Route C++ TUs to the host header
 * by absolute path (generated hoststddef.h — same trick as
 * port/shim/string.h / port/shim/stdlib.h).
 *
 * Inert in the N64 build (port/shim is not on its include path).
